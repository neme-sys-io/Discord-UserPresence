# Installation

1. Install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn:
```node.js
npm install or yarn install
```

2. Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as tokens. You can either store the `token` directly in the `.env` file or utilize built-in environment variables. 
   Here's an example of how to define a token in the `.env` file:
```
token=MTE3NjE0NTgxNTM5MjIzMTYxNg.G9_0Qz.tMGGiwsdbc6eKtfu-_dOepk_y5CuSZf4AbBqiuwd6I
```

3. Customize the strings according to your preferences. After that, execute the code in the terminal that you want to run.
```bash
node CustomRPC or SpotifyRPC or EmojiPC
```
